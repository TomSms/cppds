> this is a document for seqlist
  for seqlist, I design for a array list in first.
  so arraylist support thoes function:
```
bool insertVal(int pos,int val);
bool deleteVal(int pos,int *val);
bool modifyVal(int pos,int val);
bool getVal(int pos,int *val);
``` 
> just like add and reduce and modify and get  four operations.
  and we can use this class to get current length of the arrylist.
  and we can get the len of array have been insert.
  and this array is full? or the array is empty?

start:
	use the make command,then there will be a app 
	use ./app to run the test.
	if you want to modify the source, don't move the directory of the source file
